# Textures, Overlays, Patterns, & Particles (**T**)

## Textures & Overlays
These are any sort of texture or overlay where movement also occurs.    
If the video moves while the overlay or texture does not, this counts as movement.

**Some examples**
- TV snow/noise or film grain
- VHS effects     
(Could also count as **"F"** and/or **"C"**)
- Manga halftones
- [Moir√© patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern)    
(Though in some cases this may also be **"S"**)
- Animations with natural or added styles such as, or similar to, Gankutsuou or Mononoke
- Noticable lightleaks, bokeh, and other similar overlays that may not fall into flashing and/or flickering
- [Heat haze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirage#Heat_haze)     
(Which may also count as **"W"**)

## Patterns
Any sort of pattern that appears on screen and has some type of movement or repeats over time.

**Some examples**
- Geometric shapes, such as circles or squares (Caution: this link is also a strobe)
- Certain types of water ripples
- Mirroring, tiling, or duplication effects
- Time echo effects, speed trails, or motion trails
- [Star trails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_trail)
- [Color Banding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_banding)
- All sync elements used in the [Euphoria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq2lU-YI3Xk) AMV     
(VPR: major patterns, major peripheral, overlays, flickering, frequent cuts & dips to black, some low fps scenes)
- This is a GIF of polka dots and tiling (note: the second part could also be a strobe)

## Particles
This applies to the more obvious particle effects as well as "busy scenes," such as ones with complicated backgrounds or where several individual elements move independently.

**Some examples**
- Crowds of people or animals which move, e.g. Cells at Work and/or Shibuya Crossing
- Fireworks in live-action sources or animated in a realistic/detailed way
- Ephemeral glowing or magic
- Particle effects such as (but not limited to): 1 | 2
