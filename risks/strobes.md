# Strobes (**S**)

## Strobing
One of the most dangerous photosensitive risks as they are often the cause of seizures.
**Strobes do <u>not</u> have to be single frames flashing by**; they can also be a persistent switching at a slower, but continuous interval. 

## Light Strobes
The first type of strobe that usually comes to mind when you think of the word. It refers to switching between different high contrast colors, objects, or scenes at a persistent interval.

- Multi-flashing or successive flashing used for [flash photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_(photography))
- [Emergency vehicle lighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_vehicle_lighting)     
(This may also be **"C"**)
- Strobe lights
- Very strong, moving, and/or pulsating lens flares

## Natural-pattern Strobing
Another frequent trigger, these occur most often in nature and/or live-action videos. Colloquically called "Natural strobes."

- Any source of light that is blocked intermittently. This includes light through pillars, fans, trees, color contrasts, etc.
- Light sources partially blocked by other materials, such as leaves or a hand
- [Stroboscopic effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroboscopic_effect)
- [Wagon-wheel effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagon-wheel_effect)

## Other Strobing
- [Optical moir√© speedup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_moir%C3%A9#Speedup_of_movements_with_moir%C3%A9) or lenticular effects
- [Jerkiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerkiness), stuttering, choppy video, or footage that appears to be at a low fps rate.
- [Film strips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYF4dK5HATo)    
(This would also be **"P"** and potentially **"T"**, but **"S"** would take precedence)
