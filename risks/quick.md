# Quick Changes (Q)
Generally speaking, almost all risk categories have things that happen quickly. "Quick Changes" is a special category for items which happen quickly but do not also fit any other category.

This category is for **transitioning from one scene to another rapidly** (quick fades or quick cuts), but **only when** the sequence does not otherwise qualify as a strobe.

- Quick cuts
- Quick fades
- Several match cuts in succession
- Cuts between zooms, such as cutting from 100% to 150% to 300% quickly in succession
