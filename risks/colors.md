# Colors (**C**)
This category is almost entirely exclusive to animated videos.     
Live-action videos with scenes in this category are usually strobes, and should be labeled as such.

## Special Consideration for Colors
**Specific color(s) should always be named in relays.** Individuals may have especially high sensitivity to particular colors, but not others.    
When possible, include every color that would fall into this category. If there are flashing colors, patterns, or vivid silhouettes (e.g. the utena anime or persona games), include the specific color combinations (like "red/black high contrast scenes" or "red/green glitching"). 

## Colors
- Any case where a specific colored element is designed to draw your attention.
- Silhouettes (Example is also **"P"**)
- Pure, solid colors with little to no shading
- A solid color is 25% or more of the frame
- All grayscale except for one color
- Color field offset
- Both pure black and pure white are present
- [Color bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMPTE_color_bars)
- Invert effects

## High Contrast Colors & Scenes
Specify when the colors that stand out are in a scene that has high contrast.

Some examples:
- Black & Yellow
- Red (Also **"T"**)

## Intense Colors
Generally, these are high contrast colors & scenes, but more severe and thus should be separated for specificity.

- Glitching effects
- Colorama effects
- Two (2) or more colors of light are touching (red, green, blue, yellow, cyan, magenta, white, and/or black)
- Most [emergency vehicle lighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_vehicle_lighting), although this usually is grouped under **"S"** due to the movement
