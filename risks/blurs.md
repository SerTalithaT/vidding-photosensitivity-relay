# Blurs (**B**)
Any full screen blurs or blurring effects.    
Note that the blur need only be present; you do not have to see the transition from unblurred to blurred for this to count as a risk.

- Motion blurs
- Gaussian blurs
- Directional blurs
- Etc.

## Exclusions

- **Bokeh** is either flickering (F) or texture (T), depending on behavior
- **Motion blur when used with zooms** should only be counted as zooms and/or motion transitions (M)
- If the **blur only takes place around the border of the frame**, it should be noted as Peripheral (P) instead
