# Peripheral (**P**)

Any effects or motion that happen in the peripherary or along the edges of frames/video can be risk factors.     
Any type of peripheral effect would belong here, but **always note whether the effect is moving.**

## Peripheral Effects

- Vignettes
- Borders
- Glitches (on the edge)
- Letterboxing or pillarboxing
- Lens distortions
- Anything that moves which only takes place near the edge of the frame or only one of its sides
  - Example: fire only along the bottom edge


## Peripheral Framing
Noting peripheral framing is only necessary when the periphery elements are: (a) moving, or (b) straight lines, and/or (c) a different color from the rest of the frame.

- When the [rule of thirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds) or [leading lines](https://www.slrlounge.com/leading-lines-photography-examples/) are taken to extremes
- When the composition of a scene has straight lines near any of the edges
- [Dolly zooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_zoom) (which may also be **"W"** based on behavior)
